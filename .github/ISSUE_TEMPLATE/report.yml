        `<NAME THE FEATURE> - <SUMMARIZE THE ISSUE>`


        ### Before you start

        When opening an issue, please:

        - Note that you cannot receive assistance on development.  Try asking around on a dedicated help forum like StackOverflow.

        - Keep in mind that this library can only address the TypeScript API for CloudKitÂ JS.  Implementation details are in control of Apple only.

        - Provide as much detail as possible.  Code examples are always welcome.  The more detail you are able to provide, the better!

        - Write issues primarily in English.  While translation tools are available, you will receive better assistance with pre-translated content.  You might also add a text version in your preferred language alongside the English version.
