        ### Before You Start

        When opening an issue, please:

        - Note that we cannot provide assistance on development.  We recommend
          asking around on a dedicated help forum like StackOverflow.

        - Keep in mind that we can only address the TypeScript API for
          CloudKitÂ JS.  Implementation details are in control of Apple only.

        - Provide as much detail as possible.  Code examples are always welcome.
          The more detail you are able to provide, the better!

        - Write issues primarily in English.  While translation tools are
          available, we will be able to provide better assistance with
          pre-translated content.  You are more than welcome to include a version
          of the issue body in your preferred language alongside the English
          version.
